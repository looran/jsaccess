jsaccess demo file (not encrypted)

Sometimes you want to store files unencrypted
* because they already are PGP encrypted / signed
* because they are really big and it would take ages to decrypt

Unencrypted files will be shown in the web page file list with a
(c) after their name.


To a new unencrypted file to download:

$ jstore add-nocrypt Makefile 
Using store "/home/user/code/laurent-tools/jsaccess/jsa/store"
Enter encryption passphrase
